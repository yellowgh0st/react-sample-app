# React Sample App (Interview Assignment)

Hello and welcome to eWay-CRM job interview. We are happy to see you playing around with our code!

## Installation

### Prerequisites

To be able to run this project on your own computer, you will need [NPM & Node.JS](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

### Clone and Run

To install and run this project on your computer, please create a private repository and [duplicate](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/duplicating-a-repository) this repository to it.
Once you have all the sources on your computer, open command line in the directory where the repository was cloned into (the directory where `.gitignore` and `README.md` files are located). Run

```
npm install
```

to initialize the project structure and dependencies. Then run

```
npm start
```

A new window or tab of you default browser appears and the url is http://localhost:3000. Inside the browser the react web app is running. Feel free to edit the sources and the page will reload as you save the file.

We wish you a happy coding.

## Your Goal

The standard goal we want you to accomplish is an app that contains a form where you specify contact's email address. After submitting the form, something like a business card containing the contact's info should appear. The profile picture should be shown as well.

You should also handle the states, where wrong user input is given or no contact is found.

The [library for communication with eWay-CRM API](https://github.com/eway-crm/js-lib) is already included. 

## Commit and Push

Once you have your amazing app, commit and [push](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository) the codes to your repo. Give [rstefko](https://github.com/orgs/eway-crm/people/rstefko) and [havri](https://github.com/orgs/eway-crm/people/havri) permissions to your repository.

Let us know when the final revision is pushed (commit/tag/branch). We are looking forward to see your results.
